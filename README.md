This Project is related to the Preprocessing & Data Mining stage of Analytics. I have employed several python libraries in this namely:
Matplotlib to visualize my findings.
Pandas to manipulate data and make it suitable for plotting.
Numpy for similar purposes as pandas but mostly for applying math functions to make the data efficient for processing.
